(P)erl-based (IM)age transmission in (PSK)-Modes for #ham #hamradio #psk #fldigi

FLDIGI supports a lot of fast-transmission modes but picture transmission is more "SSTV"-domain. 
Exchanging links to pictures in the internet (aka EasyPal-Hybrid) is not a image-transfer at all.

So the idea was to combine fast-data-transfer with a GUI, optimized for Picture-transfer.
